# DW-GAN
A GAN based framework for CAPTCHA breaking in the dark web. Especially for the CAPTCHA with curve and dot noisces. For [CNN model training](https://github.com/dee1024/pytorch-captcha-recognition), Dee Qiu's code is used for reference. The [CNN Synthesizer](https://github.com/lepture/captcha) is used from an open-source CAPTCHA library. Based on that implementation, we made fine change in the code to satisfy our need for experiments. 

## Requirement
This code is implemented in Python and PyTorch. All of the required libraries could be installed by pip or conda. 
## Usage
### Data
Due to the shortage of the storage space, data is not uploaded in this repository. Please contact zhangning@email.arizona.edu for the data copy. 
### Training
GAN model is trained and uploaded. An example of making dataset for training CNN model is under the folder [Example_and_Record](https://github.com/johnnyzn/DW-GAN/blob/main/Example_and_Record/notebook_example/case_synthetizer-4.ipynb)
